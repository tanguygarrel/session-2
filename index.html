    <h1><mark><em>Let It Be </em> - The Beatles</mark><sup>2</sup></h1>
    
<p><strong><h3>Le groupe</h3></strong></p><strong><sup>2</sup>The Beatles</strong> were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band in history. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963, their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s</p> 

<p><strong><h2>Les paroles</h2></strong></p>

<p> When I find myself in times of trouble</br>
Mother Mary comes to me</br>
Speaking words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br> </p>

<p>And in my hour of darkness</br>
She is standing right in front of me</br>
Speaking words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be</br>
Whisper words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>And when the broken-hearted people</br>
Living in the world agree</br>
There will be an answer
Let it be</br></p>

<p>For though they may be parted there is</br>
Still a chance that they will see</br>
There will be an answer</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be</br>
Yeah, there will be an answer</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be</br>
Whisper words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be</br>
Whisper words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>And when the night is cloudy</br>
There is still a light that shines on me</br>
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be</br></p>

<p>I wake up to the sound of music</br>
Mother Mary comes to me</br>
Speaking words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be</br>
There will be an answer</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be</br>
There will be an answer</br>
Let it be</br></p>

<p>Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be</br>
Whisper words of wisdom</br>
Let it be</br></p>
